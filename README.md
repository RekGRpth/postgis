We are using [Weblate software](https://weblate.org) for translation.  If you want to help out, log into [OSGeo Weblate](https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis/).

If you don't already have an OSGeo account, [you can get one here](https://id.osgeo.org/ldap/create). An OSGeo account will allow you to participate in translating both the PostGIS workshop and PostGIS documentation and also submit bug tickets.
