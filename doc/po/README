Translation files for the PostGIS manual.

Compilation of the files require the ``poxml`` package,
part of the KDE development kit.

In language subdirectories, run ``make`` to build localized manual and
comments, ``make local-pdf`` for the pdf.

In parent directory (doc), run ``make update-po`` to update the translation
files to be in sync with the source code, ``make html-localized`` or
``make pdf-localized`` to build the localized html or pdf manual for
all enabled languages

Adding languages
----------------

Adding new languages implies (relative to doc/ dir):

  - Adding the language to the `translations` variable
    in Makefile.in

  - Re-running ./configure

  - Running `make update-po`

  - Adding a Makefile under the new language directory
    (take the Makefile from another language as a template,
    and only change the DOCSUFFIX)

  - Check the new language works:
    make -C po/<newlanguage>

  - Add to the git repository the changes in the Makefile.in
    and all the new files in the po/<newlanguage>/

Using transifex
---------------

Transifex web-ui to translation was setup here:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/postgis

Run ``make update-tx`` from the parent (doc) directory to
update the transifex command-line tool configuration,
found in ../.tx/config (only needed when new doc sources
are added);

Run ``make pull-tx`` to import remotely updated translations
and ``make push-tx`` to upload the locally update ones, after
making sure they are well-formed (``make html-localized`` succeeds).

NOTE: the recommended workflow is:

 make pull-tx
 do:
  make html-localized || edit
 until success
 if edits:
  make push-tx
  make pull-tx
  commit changes to repo

Using weblate [EXPERIMENTAL]
----------------------------

Weblate web-ui to translation was setup here:
https://weblate.osgeo.org/projects/postgis

Translations made via Weblate will automatically be pushed
to the a configured repository (currently robe's fork) with
'weblate' as a committer, see commit 2d5247b0c as an example.

Changes to the templates should be automatically fetched by Weblate
via webhook, see https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/postgis/postgis/settings/hooks
(currently broken because the configured repository does not match the
URL of the official repository)

Local changes to the translation files can be uploaded manually
to weblate with a command like the following:

  wlc upload \
    postgis/introductionxml/it \
    --input po/it_IT/introduction.xml.po

NOTE: wlc 1.2 is known to be not functional, while wlc 1.12
      (current latest when installed via pip) seems fine
